### About the lab

In this hands-on session, you'll learn how to build intelligent, domain-specific AI agents using **Foundry Agent Service**.  
We'll go step by step-from creating a basic agent to extending it with custom tools, external data, and live integrations.  

By the end of the workshop, you'll have built your own **Contoso PizzaBot**, an AI assistant capable of:  
- Following tailored **system prompts**  
- Using **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** to answer questions from custom documents  
- Calling **custom tools** like a pizza calculator  
- Integrating with an **MCP server** for live menu and order management  

### Agenda

- **Chapter 1: Create Your First Agent**  
  Log into Azure, install packages, and build a simple GPT-4o agent  

- **Chapter 2: System Prompts & Instructions**  
  Learn how prompts shape agent behavior and add custom instructions from "instructions.txt"

- **Chapter 3: Adding Knowledge (RAG)**  
  Ground your agent in pizza store data using File Search and a vector store  

- **Chapter 4: Tool Calling**  
  Extend your agent with a custom pizza calculator function and toolset integration  

- **Chapter 5: MCP Integration**  
  Connect to an MCP server for live pizza menus, toppings, and order management
